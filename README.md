# List of existing Bluemix Demos

Here is a list of existing and interactive demos that show off the Bluemix platform and its services.

## "5 minute" Demos

Sometimes you only have a few minutes to illustrate a core concept. Here is a list of "ready to go" demos that are already deployed and don't require any setup or preparation time.

Let's start off with **IBM Watson**. Here is a link to the Watson Developer Cloud with 20 well documented demos: http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/starter-kits.html

But there are (many) more demos showing off our growing catalog of cognitive services:
 - **Real-time tone analysis**: https://realtime-tone.mybluemix.net
 - **Visual recognition**: https://visual-recognition-demo.mybluemix.net
 - **Speech to text**: https://speech-to-text-demo.mybluemix.net
 - **Text to speech**: https://text-to-speech-demo.mybluemix.net
 - **Tradeoff analytics**: https://tradeoff-analytics-demo.mybluemix.net

Chat interfaces are becoming more prevalent in many use cases. How about using the **conversation service** to build one? Here is a demo: https://conversation-demo.mybluemix.net/

Another area of great interest to Bluemix users is the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. This demo allows you to connect your phone to the IoT platform and then visualize its sensor data: http://discover-iot.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/#/play

If you want to go beyond a single device, why not drive a few virtual **connected cars** around Las Vegas? You can even simulate accidents or make the roads freeze over: http://connected-car.mybluemix.net

How about using the IBM Blockchain service along with IoT devices to instrument and track shipments in your supply chain? Here is the demo: https://discover-iot-blockchain-staging.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/iot-blockchain.html


## "In Depth" Demos

Here is a list of more complex demos that require coding knowledge and/or significant setup time and effort.
